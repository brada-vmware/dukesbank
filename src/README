This directory contains the source code of Sun's "Duke's Bank" J2EE sample application modified to run with JBoss 4.0 and MySQL.

The sample application (j2eetutorial14.zip) was downloaded from http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/download.html#tutorial, and patched using jbossj2ee-src.zip from http://docs.jboss.org/jbossas/getting_started/v3/startguide40.zip (note that the required Zip archive was extracted from the downloaded Zip).

The JBoss patches are simple unzipped into the "j2eetutorial" directory per the instructions in their Getting Started guide: http://docs.jboss.org/jbossas/getting_started/v4/html/dukesbank.html.

The only modification necessary to make the demonstration work is to comment out the "java.naming.provider.url" property in "j2eetutorial14/examples/bank/dd/client/jndi.properties". This property (which contains environment specific host and port information) is set via the JBoss instance's JAVA_OPTS in "run.conf" with configuration data held in the ControlTier project:

$ diff jndi.properties jndi.properties.orig 
3c3
< #java.naming.provider.url=jnp://localhost:1099
---
> java.naming.provider.url=jnp://localhost:1099
